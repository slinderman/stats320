    "# Decoding Models\n",
    "\n",
    "If encoding models approximate the conditional probability of neural activity $y$ given covariates $x$, then **decoding models** do the reverse: they predict covariates given neural activity. For example, we could decode arm movements from neural activity in motor cortex to drive a prosthetic limb. Or we could decode an animal's position by measuring the activity of place cells in its hippocampus. Or we could infer what a person is seeing based on measurements of neural activity in visual cortex. All of these are examples of decoding an external signal given neural measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the day, it's all just regression. With enough data, we can train a predictive model to output $p(x \\mid y)$. However, sometimes we can be a bit more clever. With a good encoding model and a prior distribution over covariates, we can build **Bayesian decoders** to estimate the **posterior distribution** of covariates $x$ given neural activity $y$. If we don't have all the ingredients for a Bayesian decoder &mdash; if we have a good prior but a poor encoding model &mdash; we can build **structured prediction** models that capture key constraints on the outputs.  This chapter will discuss both of these approaches."
