    "\n",
    "1. Assume there are $K$ neurons in the vicinity of the probe. When the $k$-th neuron spikes, its EAP produces a signature **waveform** on the channels. We model the waveform as a vector, $\\mathbf{w}_k = (w_{k,1}, \\ldots, w_{k,N}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$, where $w_{k,n}$ represents the average magnitude of the EAP produced on channel $n$ each time neuron $k$ spikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Let $\\mathbf{a}_k = (a_{k,1}, \\ldots, a_{k,T}) \\in \\mathbb{R}_+^T$ denote the time series of spike **amplitudes** for neuron $k$. Since neurons spike only a few times a second, the amplitude is typically zero, but when the neuron does spike it has a positive amplitude. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. If two neurons fire at the same, their waveforms add together in the measured voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The voltage recordings are noisy, so in addition to the spike waveforms we also have independent Gaussian noise $\\epsilon_{n,t} \\in \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$ for each channel $n$ and time bin $t$.\n",

    "This chapter introduced the spike sorting problem for electrophysiological (\"ephys\") recordings with modern tools like Neuropixels. The same strategy applies to other ephys methods, like dense multielectrode arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this first pass, we framed the problem as one of semi-non-negative matrix factorization, or semi-NMF. We took a Bayesian approach, with priors on the waveforms and amplitudes. We derived a coordinate ascent algorithm for MAP estimation and found that the updates have pleasingly simple form. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we made an undesirable assumption in deriving this algorithm: we started by downsampling our voltage traces to the point that a spike fit within a single time bin. What is the point of recording at 30kHz if we are going to average into 2ms bins!? In the next chapter, we will relax this assumption and show how to do spike sorting with a **convolutional matrix factorization** model."

    "Modeling via matrix factorization is one of those great ideas that has been discovered over and over again. In the probabilistic machine learning literature, some nice references include:\n",
    "- {cite}`tipping1999probabilistic`: develops probabilistic PCA, an unconstrained matrix factorization\n",
    "- {cite}`lee1999learning`: non-negative matrix factorization\n",
    "- {cite}`roweis1999unifying`: PCA, sparse PCA, ICA, etc. as linear Gaussian models\n",
    "- {cite}`mnih2007probabilistic`: an unconstrained matrix factorization for the Netflix challenge\n",
    "- {cite}`ding2008convex`: semi-NMF and other related models\n",
    "- {cite}`gopalan2013efficient`: Poisson matrix factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "Many models are really matrix factorization in disguise. For example, latent Dirichlet allocation {cite}`blei2003latent` is quite similar to NMF.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I don't know of a reference for our specific model with norm constraints and exponential priors for spike sorting. However, it falls nicely within this broader landscape of matrix factorization methods, and it leads nicely to the model people actually use, as we'll see next."
