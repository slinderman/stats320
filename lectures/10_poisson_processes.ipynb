    "We can use Poisson superposition and thinning to reinterpret the Hawkes process as a cascade of Poisson processes. Note that the conditional intensity of a Hawkes process is the sum of non-negative intensity functions: a homogeneous background rate plus weighted impulse responses. An equivalent way to sample the Hawkes process is to sample points from independent Poisson processes for each term in the intensity function.\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, we can use this perspective to formulate the Hawkes process as a latent variable model. Each point has a latent **parent** &mdash; either the background or a preceding poitn &mdash. If we knew the parents, the Hawkes process would decompose into independent Poisson processes. We can leverage this formulation to do efficient Bayesian inference in Hawkes processes {cite}`linderman2014discovering`."

    "- Point processes are stochastic processes that produce discrete sets of points.  They are fundamental tools for modeling neural spike trains, where the points are spike times. \n",

    "- The Poisson process is the fundamental point process from which more complex models are constructed. \n",
    "\n",
    "- There are many ways to sample a Poisson process. We showed two: the \"two-stage\" approach of sampling the number of points and then their times; and the \"interval\" approach of repeatedly sampling inter-spike intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both approaches led to the same expression for the Poisson process likelihood, which is a concave function of the intensity. \n",
    "\n",
    "- However, the same simplifying assumptions that make Poisson processes so mathematically elegant also limit their utility for modeling data with dependencies. Renewal processes and Hawkes processes extend the Poisson process, without completely sacrificing tractability. \n",
